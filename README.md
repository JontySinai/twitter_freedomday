# Freedom Day Twitter Analysis

![](pictures/FOUNDeRY_logo_horizontal.png)

## About


This is an analysis of tweets related to Freedom Day (27th April) which marks the anniversary of the first democratic election in modern South Africa. The tweets were streamed over a 30 hour period beginning Wed April 26 16:17:26 GMT+2:00 (local Johannesburg time) and ending Thu April 27 22:17:26 GMT+2:00. 

The stream tracked tweets with the hasthags "#FreedomDay", "#SAUnite", "#savesa","#FreedomMovement" and "#27April". Where geo-tags were avialble, the stream was restricted to the geographic region with South-West corner -35 S 16 E and North-East corner -21 S 34 E (this rectangle full contains South Africa's geographic region).

54k tweets were streamed and stored in the original JSON file (at 152.3 mb this file is too big for Github) but unfortunately only 26k of these tweets were parsed by the `parseTweets` function from the package `streamR`. In another version of this analysis, it will be interesting to see how the results change when all of the tweets can be parsed from the original JSON. 

As a result of the limited parsing, the dataframe [tweets_freedom_day](tweets_freedom_day.feather) only contains tweets up to Thu April 27 12:10:45 GMT+2:00. 

## What you will find

The main feature of this repo is [freedomday_dashboard.html](freedomday_dashboard.html) which is a dashboard of visualisations of the Twitter stream. This dashboard is generated by [freedomday_dashboard.rmd](freedomday_dashboard.rmd). It is recommended that you use RStudio (see Requirements). 

The highlight of the dashboard are the visualisations on emojis :smiley:. Note that whether or not the native emoji icon (the non-colour) version will display will depend on the character encoding settings of your machine. This still needs to be standardised in the script. Emoji sentiment analysis is an ongoing area of study and much work still needs to be done, nonetheless this is an exciting and revealing first pass. 

Accompanying freedomday_dashboard.\* are all the files necessary to generate the HTML file from the RMarkdown file. These files are contained in [pictures](pictures), [feathers](feathers) and [emoji_dictionaries](emoji_dictionaries) - see Acknowledgements for source for the emoji dictionary files.  

Finally I have included [twitter_stream.rmd](twitter_stream.rmd) and [cleaning_script.r](cleaning_script.r) to show how the original Twitter data was streamed and cleaned to produce the feathers for the dashboard.

The raw twitter data has been deliberately excluded from this repo to protect user privacy. 'cleaning_script.r' is therefore a reading exercise. 

## Privacy

With the exception of high profile Twitter accounts, no single Twitter user's account has been explicitly identified throughout this project. All of the visualisations are of aggregate data and cannot be traced to a particular tweet or individual\*. All of the feather files have been anonomysed and contain no user information. 

\* The exception is the barplot of the most common @mentions, however all of the accounts in this barplot are public figure or institutional accounts. 

## How to run this project

The recommended way to run this project is to clone this repo into an RStudio project and run `freedomday_dashboard.rmd` after making sure that the required packages are installed. 

You can view the HTML file in a web browser, however there is a potential compability issue with the leaflet map. This is an issue which remains open.

## Requirements

This project was done in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). The recommended IDE is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). 

The following packages were used in this project:

* **Extraction:** `feather`, `png`, `rvest`, `streamR`, `twitteR`, `ROAuth`, `ggmap`

* **Processing:** `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `tm`, `tidytext`, `lubridate`

* **Visualisation:** `flexdashboard`, `ggplot2`, `RColorBrewer`, `wordcloud`, `leaflet`

The emoji dictionaries were made possible through the work of [Jessica Peterka-Bonneta](http://opiateforthemass.es/articles/emoticons-in-R/) and this [study](http://kt.ijs.si/data/Emoji_sentiment_ranking/about.html) on the "Sentiment of Emojis" by P.
